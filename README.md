# Application of deep and machine learning techniques for multi-label classification performance on psychotic disorder diseases

This repository is the official implementation of [Application of deep and machine learning techniques for multi-label classification performance on psychotic disorder diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821000356#cebib0010). 

## Requirements

To get the dataset:
>ðŸ“‹  Go to the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821000356#cebib0010) and download csv file from Appendix A.

To mount the dataset to Google Colab:
```setup
drive.mount('/content/drive/')
file = "/content/drive/$path/data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file)
```

To upload dataset from local:
```
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
```
>ðŸ“‹  Click on "Open in Colab". Run this cell and click 'Choose Files'

## Environment
